Q 5. Compare the result for all_courses('4000123', L) vs. all_courses2(4000123,
L). Explain the dierence.

If something is put inside of quatation marks, that means we need to treat that specific thing like an atom. 
In our prolog database, the student ID is put in quatation to make it an atom and not a variable. So that means that
in our querry we need to call all_courses with an atom as our first element. all_courses('4000123', L) does in fact use
an atom as the first element and therefore will produce a list with all courrses taken by the person with that student Id.
all_courses2(4000123,L) on the other hand passses a variable as the first element, not an atom. For this reason, 
it will not unify with any of the facts since takes_course does not take a variable as there first element.
