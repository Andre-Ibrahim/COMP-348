	This is a ground query.
	This query  field(hit_transfer,engineering) will unify with field(X, Y) .
	Variable X will be instantiated to hit_transfer.
	Variable Y will be instantiated to engineering.
	This will resolve into 2 goals: course(hit_transfer, Z) and field(Z, engineering).
	The goal course(hit_transfer, Z) will unify with course(hit_transfer, mechanical).
	Variable Z will be instantiated to mechanical.
	The goal field(mechanical, engineering) will get unified with field(mechanical, engineering).
	The resolution becomes:
	field(hit_transfer, engineering) :- course(hit_transfer, mechanical), field(mechanical, engineering).
	This will resolve to true, so the querry will be true.

	Non ground-query
	lab_number(fine_arts, X) is unifed with lab_number(fine_arts,10).
	X is instanciated to 10

3. 	(Alex)
	This is a ground querry.
	This query  field(computer, literature) will unify with field(X, Y) .
	Variable X will be instantiated to computer.
	Variable Y will be instantiated to literature.
	This will resolve into 2 goals: course(computer, Z) and field(Z, literature).
	The goal course(computer, Z) will not unify to anything and will resolve to a false.
	So the result will be false.

	Non ground query
	course(X,Y) unifes with all procedures course in the database one by one
	X is intanciated with hit_transfer, Y is intanciated with mechanical
	X is intanciated with web_design, Y is intanciated with computer
	X is intanciated with design_methods, Y is intanciated with fine-arts
	X is intanciated with poetry, Y is intanciated with literature
	X is intanciated with leadership, Y is intanciated with management
	X is intanciated with biology, Y is intanciated with medicin

	This is a ground querry.
	The querry student(adrian) will be unified with student(X).
	Variable X will be instantiated to adrian.
	This will resolve into 1 goals: student(adrian,_).
	The goal will unify with student(adrian, web_design).
	This will resolve to true, so the result will be true.

	ground query
	the query is unifed with  student(X, Y) in the database
	where X is intanciated with anna and Y with enginnering
	This will resolve into two goals field(Z, enginnering) and student(anna, Z)
	field unifes with filed(mechanical, enginnering) and Z is intanciated
	new that Z is instantiated student(anna, mechanical) is unifed with student(X, Y)
	where X is intanciated with anna and Y with mechanical
	This will resolve into two goals field(Z, mechanical) and student(anna, Z)
	field unifes with filed(mechanical, enginnering) and Z is intanciated
	
	through the rule Y is passed to fiked

	This is a non-ground querry.
	The querry student(X, enginnering) will be unified with student(X, Y).
	Variable Y will be instantiated to enginnering.
	This will resolve into 2 goals: field(Z, enginnering) and student(X, Z).
	The goal field(Z, enginnering) will unify with field(X, Y).
	The variable Z will be instantiated to hit_transfer and web_design since there
	is two enginnering, mechanical and computer.
	So Y will be instantiated to instantiated to hit_transfer and in another call to web_design.
	student(X, hit_transfer) will unify with student(anna, hit_transfer) and student(daniel, hit_transfer).
	X will be instantiated to anna and daniel.
	student(X, web_design) will unify with student(adrian, web_design).
	X will be instantiated to adiran. 
	So the querry will produce the output: X = anna, X = daniel, X = adrian

	This is a non-ground querry.
	The querry field(_, X) will unify with field(mechanical, engineering).
	X will be instantiated to engineering.
	Resolution occurs.
	The querry field(_, X) will unify with field(computer, engineering).
	X will be instantiated to engineering.
	Resolution occurs.
	The querry field(_, X) will unify with field(fine-arts, art).
	X will be instantiated to art.
	Resolution occurs.
	The querry field(_, X) will unify with field(literature, social).
	X will be instantiated to social.
	Resolution occurs.
	The querry field(_, X) will unify with field(management, buisiness).
	X will be instantiated to buisiness.
	Resolution occurs.
	The querry field(_, X) will unify with field(X, Y).
	Tis will resolve into 2 goals, course(_,Z) and field(Z,Y).
	course will be unified with all courses and Z will be instantiated to all first
	elements of course. Then Y in field(Z,Y) will also eventually be instantiated to 
	all values of field which will simply repeat the first part of the answer.
	So the querry will produce the output: X = engineering,X = engineering, X = art, X = social,
	X = buisiness, X = engineering, X = engineering, X = art, X = social, X = buisiness.

11.	(Alex)
	This is a non-ground querry.
	The querry lab_number(X, 15) will be unified with lab_number(mechanical,15).
	X will be instantiated to mechanical.
	field(mechanical, Y) will be instantiated with field(mechanical,engineering).
	Y will be instantiated to engineering.
	Resolution occurs.
	The querry lab_number(X, 15) will be unified with lab_number(X,Z).
	This will resolve into 2 goals: course(X, Y) and course(Y, Z).
	Z will be instantiated to 15.
	course(Y,15) will unify with course(mechanical, 15).
	Y will be instantiated to mechanical.
	course(X, mechanical) will unify with course(hit_transfer, mechanical).
	X will be instantiated to hit_transfer.
	field(hit_transfer, Y) will be instantiated with field(X, Y).
	X will instantiate to hit_transfer.
	field(hit_transfer, Y) will resolve into course(hit_transfer, Z) and field(Z,Y).
	Z will be instantiated to mechanical anf Y to enginerring.
	Resolution occurs.
	So the querry will produce the output: X = mechanical and Y = engineering, X = hit_transfer and Y = engineering
