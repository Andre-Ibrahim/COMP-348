	Question 7
##############################

1. 
	This is a ground query.
	This query  field(hit_transfer,engineering) will unify with field(X, Y) .
	Variable X will be instantiated to hit_transfer.
	Variable Y will be instantiated to engineering.
	This will resolve into 2 goals: course(hit_transfer, Z) and field(Z, engineering).
	The goal course(hit_transfer, Z) will unify with course(hit_transfer, mechanical).
	Variable Z will be instantiated to mechanical.
	The goal field(mechanical, engineering) will get unified with field(mechanical, engineering).
	The resolution becomes:
	field(hit_transfer, engineering) :- course(hit_transfer, mechanical), field(mechanical, engineering).
	This will resolve to true, so the querry will be true.

2.
	Non ground-query
	lab_number(fine_arts, X) is unifed with lab_number(fine_arts,10).
	X is instanciated to 10

3.
	This is a ground query.
	This query  field(computer, literature) will unify with field(X, Y) .
	Variable X will be instantiated to computer.
	Variable Y will be instantiated to literature.
	This will resolve into 2 goals: course(computer, Z) and field(Z, literature).
	The goal course(computer, Z) will not unify to anything and will resolve to a false.
	So the result will be false.
_______________________________

4.
	Non ground query
	course(X,Y) unifes with all procedures course in the database one by one
	X is intanciated with hit_transfer, Y is intanciated with mechanical
	X is intanciated with web_design, Y is intanciated with computer
	X is intanciated with design_methods, Y is intanciated with fine-arts
	X is intanciated with poetry, Y is intanciated with literature
	X is intanciated with leadership, Y is intanciated with management
	X is intanciated with biology, Y is intanciated with medicin

5.
	This is a ground query.
	The query student(adrian) will be unified with student(X).
	Variable X will be instantiated to adrian.
	This will resolve into 1 goals: student(adrian,_).
	The goal will unify with student(adrian, web_design).
	This will resolve to true, so the result will be true.
	
	
_______________________________

6.
	ground query
	the query is unifed with  student(X, Y) in the database
	where X is intanciated with anna and Y with enginnering
	This will resolve into two goals field(Z, enginnering) and student(anna, Z)
	field unifes with filed(mechanical, enginnering) and Z is intanciated
	new that Z is instantiated student(anna, mechanical) is unifed with student(X, Y)
	where X is intanciated with anna and Y with mechanical
	This will resolve into two goals field(Z, mechanical) and student(anna, Z)

	field(Z, enginnering)  unifes with field(X, Y) and resolves into course(X, Z) and filed(Z, enginnering)
	filed(Z, enginnering) unifes with filed(mechanical, enginnering) which means Z is instanciated with mechancial
	course(X, mechanical) is unified with course course(hit_transfer, mechanical)
	Z from the initial filed call is then insiated with hit_transfer
	since Z is instantiated to hit_trasfer we have student(anna, hit_transfer)
	that finds a match in the database which means our query evaluates to true

7.
	This is a non-ground query.
	The query student(X, enginnering) will be unified with student(X, Y).
	Variable Y will be instantiated to enginnering.
	This will resolve into 2 goals: field(Z, enginnering) and student(X, Z).
	The goal field(Z, enginnering) will unify with field(X, Y).
	The variable Z will be instantiated to hit_transfer and web_design since there
	is two enginnering, mechanical and computer.
	So Y will be instantiated to instantiated to hit_transfer and in another call to web_design.
	student(X, hit_transfer) will unify with student(anna, hit_transfer) and student(daniel, hit_transfer).
	X will be instantiated to anna and daniel.
	student(X, web_design) will unify with student(adrian, web_design).
	X will be instantiated to adiran. 
	So the query will produce the output: X = anna, X = daniel, X = adrian
_______________________________

8.
	Non-ground query
	student(X, fine-arts) unifes with student(X, Y) where Y is instanciated with fine-arts
	it is then resolved to filed(Z, fine-arts) and student(X, Z).
	filed(Z, fine-arts) is unfied with filed(X, Y) and is resolved to course(X, Z) and filed(Z, fine-arts).
	since filed(_, fine-arts) resolves to a false statement there is no course in the database that meets these goals.
	this means that student(X, fine-arts) will result into false after exausting the database.

9.
	This is a non-ground query.
	The query field(_, X) will unify with field(mechanical, engineering).
	X will be instantiated to engineering.
	Resolution occurs.
	The querry field(_, X) will unify with field(computer, engineering).
	X will be instantiated to engineering.
	Resolution occurs.
	The querry field(_, X) will unify with field(fine-arts, art).
	X will be instantiated to art.
	Resolution occurs.
	The querry field(_, X) will unify with field(literature, social).
	X will be instantiated to social.
	Resolution occurs.
	The querry field(_, X) will unify with field(management, buisiness).
	X will be instantiated to buisiness.
	Resolution occurs.
	The querry field(_, X) will unify with field(X, Y).
	Tis will resolve into 2 goals, course(_,Z) and field(Z,Y).
	course will be unified with all courses and Z will be instantiated to all first
	elements of course. Then Y in field(Z,Y) will also eventually be instantiated to 
	all values of field which will simply repeat the first part of the answer.
	So the query will produce the output: X = engineering,X = engineering, X = art, X = social,
	X = buisiness, X = engineering, X = engineering, X = art, X = social, X = buisiness.

10.
	This is a non-ground query.
	The query lab_number(_,X) will be unified with lab_number(X,Z).
	lab_number(X, Z) will resolve into 2 goals: course(X,Y) and lab_number(Y,Z).
	The goal lab_number(Y,Z) will unify with lab_number(mechanical,15) and lab_number(mechanical,10).
	Z will be insantiated to 15 and 10 at two separte times.
	We do not care what the goal course(X,Y) will produce.
	X from querry will be instantiated to 15 and 10 also.
	In the querry, field(X,Y) will now be evaluated, keeping in mind the coma means and.
	field(15, Y) will not be able to unify with anything and will reolve to false.
	field(10, Y) will not be able to unify with anything and will reolve to false.
	So the querry will propduce a false and no results will be produced.

11.
	This is a non-ground query.
	The query lab_number(X, 15) will be unified with lab_number(mechanical,15).
	X will be instantiated to mechanical.
	field(mechanical, Y) will be instantiated with field(mechanical,engineering).
	Y will be instantiated to engineering.
	Resolution occurs.
	The querry lab_number(X, 15) will be unified with lab_number(X,Z).
	This will resolve into 2 goals: course(X, Y) and course(Y, Z).
	Z will be instantiated to 15.
	course(Y,15) will unify with course(mechanical, 15).
	Y will be instantiated to mechanical.
	course(X, mechanical) will unify with course(hit_transfer, mechanical).
	X will be instantiated to hit_transfer.
	field(hit_transfer, Y) will be instantiated with field(X, Y).
	X will instantiate to hit_transfer.
	field(hit_transfer, Y) will resolve into course(hit_transfer, Z) and field(Z,Y).
	Z will be instantiated to mechanical anf Y to enginerring.
	Resolution occurs.
	So the query will produce the output: X = mechanical and Y = engineering, X = hit_transfer and Y = engineering

12. 

	This is a non-ground query.
	the query student(X) will be unified with student(X). 
	student(X) will resolve into one goal: student(X,_).
	student(X,_) will unify with student(anna, hit_transfer).
	X will be instantiated to anna.
	Resolution occurs.
	The cut operation is reached, so no more backtracking.
	Since X is already instantiated to ana, the next operation is student(anna,_).
	This will get unified to student(X,Y).
	X will be instantiated with anna, Y to _.
	This will resolve into field(Z, _) and student(anna,Z).
	Z will be instantiated to hit_transfer (this happens after field is resolve into 2 
	course and field).
	student(anna, hit_transfer) will be unified with student(anna, hit_transfer).
	Resolution occurs.
	So the query will produce the output X = anna.
	

13. 	(Alex)
	This is a non-ground query.
	the query student(X) will be unified with student(X). 
	student(X) will resolve into one goal: student(X,_).

	X will be instantiated to anna.
	Prolog will backtrack to querry student(X,_).
	X will be instantiated to anna. 
	student(anna,_) will be unified with student(anna, hit_transfer).
	Resolution occurs. 
	The cut operation is reached, so prolog will exit.
	So the query will produce the output X = anna.
