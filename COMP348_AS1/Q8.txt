part 1) magic(Hermione).
	The querry magic(Hermione) will be unified with magic(X).
	This will resolve into 1 goal: house_elf(X).
	The goal house_elf(X) will unify with house_elf(dobby).
	X will be instantiated to dobby.
	Hermione will be instantiated to dobby.
	Prolog will backtrack and The querry magic(Hermione) will be unified with magic(X).
	This will resolve into 1 goal: wizard(X).
	The goal wizard(X) will unify with wizzard(dobby).
	X will be instantiated to dobby.
	Hermione will be instantiated to dobby.
	Prolog will backtrack and The querry magic(Hermione) will be unified with magic(X).
	This will resolve into 1 goal: witch(X).
	The goal witch(X) will unify with witch(hermione).
	X will be instantiated to hermione.
	Hermione will be instantiated to hermione.
	Prolog will backtrack and the goal witch(X) will unify with witch(mcGonagall).
	X will be instantiated to mcGonagall.
	Hermione will be instantiated to mcGonagall.
	Prolog will backtrack and The goal witch(X) will unify with witch(rita_skeeter).
	X will be instantiated to rita_skeeter.
	Hermione will be instantiated to rita_skeeter.
	So this querry will have these reolves:
	Hermione = dobby, Hermione = dobby, Hermione = hermione, Hermione = mcGonagall, Hermione = rita_skeeter
	
part 2) magic(hermione).
	The querry magic(hermione) will be unified with magic(X).
	X will be instantiated to hermione.
	This will resolve into 1 goal: house_elf(X).
	X will be instantiated to hermione.
	house_elf(hermione) will not unify to anytihng so it will resolve to false.
	Prolog will backtrack to magic(hermione).
	magic(hermione) will be unified with magic(X).
	X will be instantiated to hermione.
	This will resolve into 1 goal: wizard(X).
	X will be instantiated to hermione.
	wizzard(hermione) will not unify to anytihng so it will resolve to false.
	Prolog will backtrack to magic(hermione).
	magic(hermione) will be unified with magic(X).
	X will be instantiated to hermione.
	This will resolve into 1 goal: wotch(X).
	X will be instantiated to hermione.
	witch(hermione) will unify with witch(hermione).
	This will resolve to true. So the querry will come back true.
